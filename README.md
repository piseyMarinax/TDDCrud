# TDDCrud

TDD Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: first the developer writes an (initially failing) automated test case that defines a desired improvement or new function, then produces the minimum amount of code to pass that.

CRUD The CRUD cycle describes the elemental functions of a persistent database. CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update and Delete. (Retrieve may occasionally be substituted for Read.) These functions are also descriptive of the data life cycle.

So, the TDD approach we are going to follow is very simple.

1/ Think of the feature we are going to implement
2/ Write Feature/unit test required to test the feature
3/ Run the test, keep writing code to take the test from green to red
4/ Once test passes, optimize and refactor the code
5/ Keep running the test in refactor process to verify you are not breaking the functionality
